# EndOfYearProject2
A replica of existing "World's Hardest Game" video game. This version is a specific level of the game, as it includes coin collection and a different board
Coded in Java
Goal of the game is to move the square to the other side of the board without hitting any of the circles moving on the board. A bonus would be picking up the coins while trying to get the square to the other side.
